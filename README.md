# Automatic-Street-Light
Automatic Street Light Control System is a simple and powerful concept, which uses 555IC as a switch to switch ON and OFF the street light automatically. By using this system manual works are removed. It automatically switches ON lights when the sunlight goes below the visible region of our eyes. It automatically switches OFF lights under illumination by sunlight. This is done by a sensor called Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) which senses the light actually like our eyes. By using this system energy consumption is also reduced because now-a-days the manually operated street lights are not switched off properly even the sunlight comes and also not switched on earlier before sunset. In sunny and rainy days, ON time and OFF time differ significantly which is one of the major disadvantages of using timer circuits or manual. This project exploits the working of a IC 555 pins to switch ON and switch OFF the lights at appropriate time with the help of an electromagnetically operated switch.
